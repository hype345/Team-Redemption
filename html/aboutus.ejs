    <h1 class=heading>About Us</h1>
    <p class=text>The McElderry Youth Redemption Boxing Program, re-named Ashley’s Garden in memory of Ashley Long, is a community-based and driven kickboxing program in East Baltimore.  Run by Alex Long, the program targets at risk youth who have suffered gun violence and trauma, offering constructive and healthy alternatives to help children and teens cope with the everyday struggles that plague their community.  As seen in the recently released documentary film CHARM CITY, Ashley’s Garden has been running kickboxing programs for youth over the last three years.  The program currently uses a room at the Safe Streets East Baltimore building to run the training.  We are currently raising funds to rent and retrofit a gym space in the neighborhood that is easily accessible by the youth.  We are also raising funds to buy the youth proper gear for training and competition.</p>
    <h2 class=subheading>Our Founder: Alex Long</h2>
    <p class=text>Alex Long is the founder of the Team Redemption Boxing Gym which provides fitness and boxing-related extra-curricular activities for kids in his community. Growing up in East Baltimore, Alex was separated from siblings and parents in foster care, but he received a lot of support from his athletic coaches, which helped keep him motivated to stay on a positive path. More recently, he and his family suffered a great tragedy when his sister Ashley was murdered. Alex wants the boys in his neighborhood to get the same care and guidance that he received, and to have the strength to pursue positive goals despite the challenges that life puts in our paths. He is known as a generous and hard-working community activist and an active member of Safe Streets (an anti-violence program in Baltimore). The boxing gym is a safe space for kids to get strong both physically and emotionally, and to find the support to prepare for a meaningful and positive life.</p>
