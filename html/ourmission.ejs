    <h1 class=heading>Our Mission</h1>

    <p class=text>We hope to construct a community around boxing in our neighborhood. We aim to provide a safe place for children to exercise and have fun in the weekends or after school.</p>

    <h2 class=subheading>Why Boxing?</h2>

    <p class=text2>Boxing is a fun sport. Schools might not have a boxing program for their student, so we provide one. We wish more children are able to develop their interests on boxing.<br />

        <br />

        Boxing can be useful sometime. Boxing is not just a sport. It is also a self defense technique. In todayâ€™s world, even kids can run into troubles. If they know how to defense themselves better in troublesome situations, they could have more confidence and be safer.</p>
